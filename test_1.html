****************************************************
Handling Public vs. Private Variables and Functions*
****************************************************
I handle my public variables in a way so that I can use them to store information that might be needed elsewhere outside of the object that they are created in.
I lock down data inside functions when I use private variables. I can use the use of private variables to keep things from running together,
but I prefer to define all of my major variables outside of my functions in most cases. Mostly since in my experience that if you aren't careful,
you can easily run into memory issues from the same variable being created over and over again. The for loop is an example of this.
If I were to create the variable inside to for loop, it would be private, but the for loop would keep creating the same variable.
In this exercise it isn't that big of an issue, but in a few of the scripts that I have written, if I overlooked that, I could run it memory problems with the
amount of data I was working with.
